What is Sound Hound?

Sound Hound is a Web Application I created from the perspective of a DJ. 
This application allows you to add songs to a list but with additional information that a DJ would use for mixing. 
There are four fields for each song:

1.	Song (Title)
2.	Artist
3.	Key (Musical Key)
4.	BPM (Beats Per Minute i.e. the tempo of the song)


How to use the application

Right now this is a very simple project. There are 3 tabs in the App.

1.	Home – Just a simple landing page. I have plans on expanding it further and adding information for the user about the App.

2.	Your Songs – This page contains the songs the user has added to their list. It shows the four fields for each song and contains “Edit” and “Delete” buttons. 
If the user selects the “Edit” button a new page will pop up where they can edit the song and then select the “Update Song” button for their changes to be saved. 
The “Delete” button simply removes the song from their list.

3.	Add a Song – On this page a user can add information for a new song to be added to their list. The user simply needs to enter information into each field and select the "Add Song" button.
Once they complete this step a confirmation page will pop up and the song will be added to their "Your Songs" list.


Features to be added

I would like to expand the app and add new features in the future to increase the usability. 
A couple features would be to add Search and Filter capabilities on the “Your Songs” page.
